    <h1>Tripe Soup</h1>
    <p>Tripe soup or is a soup or stew made with tripe (cow, lamb or mutton stomach). It is a traditional dish in many cultures and regions throught the world, from the Balkans to Southeast Asia and the Americas</p>
    <p>Romanian journalist Radu Anton Roman said this about it: "This dish looks like it is made for drunk coachmen but it has the most sophisticated and pretentious mode of preparation in all Romanian cuisine. It's sour and sweet, hot and velvety, fatty but delicate, eclectic and simple at the same time."</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tripe</li>
        <li>Beef bone</li>
        <li>White vinegar</li>
        <li>Parsnip</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Celery root</li>
        <li>Sour cream</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Cook the ingredients:</b> In a big pot, add the tripe, beef bones, carrots, celery, onion, parsnip and water. Bring to a boil then reduce heat to medium and cook for 2 to 3 hours or until the tripe is tender.</li>
        <li><b>Prep the tripe and soup:</b> Transfer the bones and the vegetables from the soup, only the tripe pieces should be left. Shred the boiled carrots. In a small pan add a tbsp olive and sauté the carrots for 2 to 3 minutes. The carrots are what’s going to give the soup that nice yellow color.</li>
        <li><b>Finish the soup:</b> In a small bowl whisk the eggs with the sour cream. Add a ladle of the hot broth to the egg mixture and stir, repeat this another 2 or 3 times. Pour this mixture back into the soup and stir. Add the sautéed carrots, the minced garlic and the vinegar to the soup and stir. Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste. Make sure you taste it and if you require more vinegar feel free to add more. I prefer mine with a bit more vinegar, but this is something that each person can add to their bowl, instead of adding it to the whole soup, so don’t over do it.</li>
        <li><b>Serve:</b> Garnish with parsley and serve hot with additional garlic sauce and hot peppers such as red chilies whether pickled or fresh.</li>
    </ol>
